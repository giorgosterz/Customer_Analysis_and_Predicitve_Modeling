More specifically, from the 10,000 people in our dataset, 2000 have exited the bank. Now let's move on to the information we can draw from the picture. \n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, it is crystal clear that the churn problem is located to our customers between 45 and 60 years old. That is the timeframe which follows right after the age range where the majority of our customers fall in. Simply put, even though the biggest percentage of our customers is in their 30's, it is people after 40 years old who seem to be leaving the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this happening? A possible explanation could be that the bank's employees did a similar analysis and saw that their customers are mainly in their 30's. Thus, they put all the weight and effort into creating products and services specifically targeted for them, neglecting the needs of people outside this age cap. As a result these people started looking for better oportunities in other financial institutes and when they did, they moved on with allocating their money to them. Of course, that is one of the million reasons that the churn problem is occuring, and a much deeper analysis should be conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we can see that for the ages between 75 and 90 years old customers, almost 100% are staying with the bank. Even though that might have a logical explanation such that people of older age simple cannot be bothered with moving to another institution, the fact that we are having a 100% success rate makes us having second toughts. These kind of numbers are too good to be true. So the case might be that we actually have a very low number of observations in this age group in our dataset, which should be considered as outliers. This becomes more important in our model developing following our initial analysis where these outliers and should be treated seperately.\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicator takes us to our next graph. We want to acquire more specific-to-out-dataset information this time so we will plot the age of customers against the number of observation we have for each bin. This way we will also come to a conclusion regarding the older age group paradox."

In banking, the term is called \"stickiness\" or \"the share of the wallet\" of the customer. The greater the \"share of the wallet\" the harder is for the customer to just abandon the bank. And that behavior is what we are oberving in the first two bins. People who have 2 products with the bank are much less likely to leave compared to the people who have 1. But then, when we move on to the next bins we are witnessing an anomaly. We see that when we get to 3 and 4 products, customers are leaving at a rapid rate. We have an 83% and 100% churn rate which does not apply for intuition whatsoever. Those are massive anomalies and we need to understand what we can do about them.\n",

People over 80 years old seemed to have 100% churn rate but that was only because we had a very low number of observations in those bins. What if there's like only a hundrend people that had 4 products and they all just happened to leave.\n",

We would much rather look at country or gender because their differences are massive and there we can actually have an impact and act upon the issue maybe by creating some business rules or by takeing some decisions to tackle that.

If we provided sufficient tuning there is a chance that the neural network would perform better than the XGB classifier but most probably it would not surpass it to an extreme amount. There is definitely not a \"clear winner\" etween the two. Besides, following a common saying in data science \"There is no free lunch\". So at every problem we should experiment with all kind of different solutions and keep the one that performs the best in each particular case!\n",
